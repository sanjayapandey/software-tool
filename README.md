The current ongoing work of the OpenOrbiter CubeSat Development Initiative is to build a small spacecraft system using open source software and open hardware principles. The main objective of the development is to give access to space for little payloads, which can be planned and executed by researchers, designs and even understudies majoring in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) and different orders to play out a huge number of planned missions. To design and develop any system, requirement engineering plays a vital role as it describes the functional and non-functional requirements of the system. The work presented in this paper is focused on developing a requirement engineering tool that can be used to increase the requirement elicitation and specification of system-wide qualities based on the use of quality attribute scenarios. The model-based requirement engineering tool described in the paper allows to link non-functional requirements and functional requirements. It utilizes quality attribute scenarios (templates) which is proposed by  Carnegie Mellon Software Engineering Institute (SEI).
